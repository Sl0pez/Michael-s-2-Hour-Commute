        <h3>To a school 12 minutes away</h3>

        <p class="txt">
            Michael is a 3-year-old boy who lives in Ditmars, Queens in New York. He wakes up at 5:30 am every day, crying because he still wants to sleep, brushes his teeth, eats some breakfast, and embarks on a 2-hour bus ride to his school. Michael is diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It affects his motor skills and ability to speak coherently. He goes to an early intervention school that helps him work through his disorder by, in addition to regular classes, giving him physical therapy, occupational therapy, and helping him with his speech. </p>

        <p class="txt">
            Michael’s family wishes to remain anonymous because they don’t want their son to be the subject of retaliation from his school, the Office of Pupil Transportation (OPT), the agency that coordinates school bus assignments and routes for the city's Education Department, or the private bus company contracted by the city. The want their son to be referred to only as “Michael.” This is his story.
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            Michael lives in Ditmars, 20 minutes or so from his school, NYL Forest Hills West, a preschool for children 2-5 years old. His family moved to the US from the Philippines 3 years ago when his dad got a job offer with better pay.
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            The move has been hard on the young family because they don’t have family and friends with them. “It’s a lot harder because we don’t have yayas (maids) and family here,” said Michael’s mother referring to the fact that their family is still in the Philippines. “We have to do everything ourselves which is why I stay home to look after the babies and do all the house chores.” </p>

        <p class="txt">
            Michael’s mom loves his school. “The teachers are great, [Michael] has an occupational therapist, a speech therapist, and he’s going to go into PT (physical therapy) soon. He needs all the help he can get, and the schools fill up pretty fast. [The classes] have 8 people, a teacher, and 3 assistants so my son is really taken care of.”

            His mom says that without traffic, the car ride to his school can be as short as 11 minutes but because he is the first on his bus route, he has to endure a 2-hour long commute to school every day.
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            When Michael started school in February, his mom says that the bus would come around as early as 6:00 am to bring him to his school where classes start around 8:20 am. </p>

        <p class="txt">
            “There was one time the heater was on his face and he got a nosebleed and he was in the bus for too long,” says Michael’s mom. “I called [the bus company] and they told me that the manager would speak to me and call me back and they asked for my number, but I haven’t gotten a call back.”
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            In the afternoon, he leaves school at 2 pm and arrives home between 3 and 3:30 pm. An hour and a half commute is something Michael’s family is okay with.
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            However, his pick-up time has gradually decreased to 6:30 am and on good days, to 7:00 am as a result of his family’s constant calls to the Office of Pupil Transportation and through coordination with the bus company, Alina Services Corp, through their school.
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            His mom says that they call the OPT every day, hoping for a solution to Michael’s long commute.
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            The bus situation is frustrating for the family because they have no other means of transportation for Michael to get to school. Michael’s dad drives to work at 7:30 am every day which means that if he drops Michael off on the way to work, Michael would be at the school before it opened. Michael’s mom has yet to learn how to drive and needs to stay home with his younger sibling.
        </p>


        <p class="txt">
            Michael’s bus situation is not out of the norm, according to Sara Catalinotto of Parents to Improve School Transportation (PIST). “It’s not really a person-centered kind of a system, it’s being programmed the same way you might do any kind of logistics for getting packages delivered from one point to another and that’s not what our kids need,” she said.
        </p>


        <p class="txt">
            According to Catalinotto, there is a policy in place where a bus ride within the borough should only be 90 minutes in total, accounting for 15 minutes in traffic. The total limit for a bus ride also decreases depending on the age of the students. However, based on reports they have uncovered (with the students’ names redacted) the PIST have found that most buses fill up the 90 minutes with multiple stops to houses and even other schools that don’t necessarily have the same dismissal times.
        </p>
        
        <p class="txt">
        “It’s almost 3 hours on the bus?” exclaims Michael’s mom. “It’s not acceptable!”
